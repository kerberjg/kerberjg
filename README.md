I'm a Senior Software Engineer👩‍💻, Game Developer👾, Cloud Architect☁️ and UI/UX Designer💅!

I'm passionate about creating UI with a delicious look&feel, writing highly efficient code, and building fun games~

These days I mainly code in Flutter/Dart 🩵🎯 (which I contribute to),
but my previous background is in TypeScript/Node.js.

I also spend a lot of time designing game characters & mechanics, cloud architectures, and writing Software Design Documents,              
just approach in a [_weird_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/weird#:~:text=Connected%20with%20fate%20or%20destiny%3B%20able%20to%20influence%20fate.), esoteric way 🔮💅✨🌙                
(after all, [_computers are magical rocks we tricked into thinking after we put lightning in them_](https://i.redd.it/o33ryb4zfc6z.jpg))



### \~Trivia\~
- 💅 **Hobbies**: cooking, games, quirky/chic fashion, tinkering with code/electronics 
- 🍕 **Favorite snack**: pizza!
- 💜 **Pronouns**: she/her
- 👀 **Fun fact**: when I was in middle school I wrote a script to do my math homework for me because somehow that seemed easier (it wasn't - but was infinitely more interesting ☺️)
